# Convertor
A string containing n binary representations on 8 bits is given as a character string.
Obtain the string containing the numbers corresponding to the given binary representations.
Example:
Given: '10100111b', '01100011b', '110b', '101011b'
Obtain: 10100111b, 01100011b, 110b, 101011b

Each string that represents a number will be converted from binary to decimal in Assembly and then the decimal
number resulted from it will be converted to binary in C.
